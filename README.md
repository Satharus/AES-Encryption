# AES Encryption

128-bit AES Encryption (Rijndael cipher) implemented using x86 assembly.


## Dependancies
All you need is `make` and `nasm`.

Install them using your package manager. 
#### Ubuntu and its derivatives
``` # apt-get update && apt install nasm make```
#### Arch Linux
``` # pacman -S nasm make```

## Steps to run
- Clone this repo.
- Run ```make``` to build the and link the program.	
- Run the executable using ```./AES-Encryption```.
- You can also run the executable as a server. To do so, run the executable with the port as an argument.
	- ```./AES-Encryption 9001```
	- This feature is a WIP.

## How to use

The program has 2 modes, encryption and decryption.
- When encrypting, you just need to give it the key and the message as 16 byte long ascii strings.
	- You will get the encrypted message as a 4x4 matrix.
	- Ex: 
	
		0x4C 0x46 0x9F 0xB6
		
		0x2D 0x7A 0x9B 0x90 
		
		0xB7 0xDF 0xFC 0xB3
		
		0x28 0xA5 0x15 0x3A

When decrypting, you have to give it the 16 bytes you were given as the encrypted message and the key. The encrypted message is give as 16 2-digit hex bytes, using lowercase characters for a-f.
